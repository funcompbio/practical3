<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have your computer set up to work with the Unix command-line.</li>
<li>Download epidemiological data from the Catalan SIVIC network.</li>
<li>Setting up Git.</li>
<li>Setting up a personal access token in GitHub.</li>
<li>Setting up a Git repo in your local disk.</li>
<li>Update your local Git repo.</li>
<li>Upload your local Git repo to GitHub.</li>
<li>Cloning a GitHub repo into a local Git repo.</li>
<li>Push changes to GitHub.</li>
<li>Pull changes from GitHub.</li>
<li>Undo changes in your local Git repo.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>In this practical we will learn to use the Git version control system
(VCS). You need to have access to a Unix <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line
interface (CLI)</a> and to the Git VCS software. If you are doing this
practical in your own computer, please check the <a
href="/setup/">setup</a> webpage to make sure that you have access to
some flavor of a Unix operating system, its CLI and the Git VCS.</p>
<p>We will use the data files called
<code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> and
<code>virus_detectats.csv</code> downloaded and prepared in either <a
href="/practical1/">practical 1</a> or <a
href="/practical%202/">practical 2</a>. If you don’t have these files,
please review one of those two practicals and generate them again. Once
you have obtained those two files, copy them into a fresh new directory
called <code>practical3</code>.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-git">Setting up Git</h1>
<p>We start setting up some global options for Git. You only need to do
this once in your computer. Make sure you have Git installed in your
system by opening the Unix shell and typing:</p>
<pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>
<p>If you get no answer from this command, it means that you need to
install the Git software. Check out the <a href="/setup/">setup</a> page
for instructions about how to install it. Once Git is installed, the
previous command should give you the installed version of the Git
software.</p>
<p>Now you should set up your identity with Git by giving your name and
email address. This information is important because Git will store it
in every commit and will allow you and others to track which changes you
have made. To set up your identity type:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name &quot;XXXXX YYYY&quot;
$ git config --global user.email &quot;ZZZZ@WWWW.UUUU&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where <code>XXXXX</code> is your first name and <code>YYYYY</code> is
your family name, while <code>ZZZZ@WWWW.UUUU</code> if you student UPF
email address. Another handy additional instruction is to tell Git to
store your GitHub credentials into a hidden file
<code>~/.git-credentials</code> to avoid having to enter them each time
you do an operation that requires them, such as <em>pushing</em> your
changes to a remote GitHub repo. To set up that option type on the
shell</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global credential.helper store</code></pre>
<p>You will need to write a message associated with each commit you make
to your Git repo. This can be done either in the command line with the
<code>-m</code> option of the <code>git commit</code> command, or in a
text editor that Git will launch for you. For that reason, it is useful
to set up your favorite text editor associated with Git, so that when
Git requires you to write some text, your favorite text editor is
launched. Please check the documentation in the following <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/associating-text-editors-with-git">link</a>
to find out how to set your favorite text editor associated with Git. If
you do not set up any text editor, it iss likely that when Git needs it,
it will start a classical text editor, such as Vi or Emacs. In the case
of Vi, to write any text, you first need to press the key of the letter
‘i’ to start typing. Once you are finished typing the message, press the
<code>Esc</code> key, type the colon character (<code>:</code>), and
finally type ‘x’ for save and quit the Vi editor.</p>
<p>To verify that you have set up your global configuration data
correctly, please type:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config -l</code></pre>
<p>Git has built-in documentation that you can access in different
ways:</p>
<pre><code>$ git help
$ git help command
$ git command --help</code></pre>
<p>where <code>command</code> is one of Git’s commands such as
<code>add</code>, <code>commit</code> or <code>push</code>.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-a-personal-access-token-in-github">Setting up a
personal access token in GitHub</h1>
<p>Since August 2021, GitHub has raised their security standards by
separating the way in which we authenticate ourselves with a username
and a password into our GitHub profile at <a
href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>, from the way in which
we authenticate ourselves to perform Git operations from the Unix
command line that affect a remote repo in <a
href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>; see this <a
href="https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations">blog
post</a> if you want to have an intuition about GitHub acces tokens and
this <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens">page</a>
for full details on how to generate them.</p>
<p>In summary, in both situations we should use the same username, but
with <strong>different</strong> passwords. <strong>For accessing our
GitHub profile</strong> at <a
href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> we will use the
password we set when we created our profile, while <strong>for
performing Git operations from the Unix command line that affect a
remote repo</strong> in <a
href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> we need to generate
another one, which GitHub calls a <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal
access token</a>, with the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Log into your GitHub profile at <a
href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and go to the
<code>Settings</code> option from the pull-down menu of your
profile.</p>
<p><img src="./ConfAccessToken1.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <code>Developer settings</code> tab located on the
left-side menu panel.</p>
<p><img src="./ConfAccessToken2.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <code>Personal access token</code> tab located on
the left-side menu panel.</p>
<p><img src="./ConfAccessToken3.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <code>Generate new token</code> button.</p>
<p><img src="./ConfAccessToken4.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>In the form for generating a new personal access token enter
<code>fcb</code> on the <code>Note</code> field, set the
<code>Expiration</code> pull-down menu to <code>No expiration</code> and
select the checkbox <code>repo</code> among the
<code>Select scopes</code> options.</p>
<p><img src="./ConfAccessToken5.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the button <code>Generate token</code> at the bottom of
the page.</p>
<p><img src="./ConfAccessToken6.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>In the new page showing the personal access token, click on the
copy icon, or select and copy the token yourself, and store it securely
somewhere in your local disk. <strong>This is the password you will have
to use</strong> when you perform Git operations from the Unix command
line that affect a remote repo in <a
href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>, such as the ones we
will see in sections <a
href="#upload-your-local-git-repo-to-github">Upload your local Git repo

<h1 id="setting-up-a-git-repo-in-your-local-disk">Setting up a Git repo
in your local disk</h1>
<p>Here we are going to set up our first Git repository, commonly
referred to with the shorthand Git <em>repo</em>, in our local disk.
First make sure you have a directory called <code>practical3</code> with
the two CSV files <code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> and
<code>virus_detectats.csv</code>. Now, enter the <code>practical3</code>
directory and type the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ git init</code></pre>
<p>Verify that the <code>.git</code> database directory has been created
by typing (you should see a directory called <code>.git/</code> next to
your CSV files):</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lhaF
total 4864
drwxr-xr-x    5 robert  staff   160B Oct  6 18:51 ./

-rw-r--r--@   1 robert  staff   1.2M Oct  6 18:51 virus_detectats.csv</code></pre>
<p>Checkout the status of your Git repo using
<code>git status</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
    mostres_analitzades.csv
    virus_detectats.csv

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre>
<p>You should note that we have two modified files that are “untracked”
(unstaged). Stage those files by using the <code>git add</code> command
and check the status again:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add .
$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        new file:   mostres_analitzades.csv
        new file:   virus_detectats.csv</code></pre>
<p>Finally, commit the staged files by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ git commit -m &#39;First commit.&#39;
[main (root-commit) 3a7b39e] First commit
 2 files changed, 28448 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 mostres_analitzades.csv

    First commit</code></pre>
<h1 id="update-your-local-git-repo">Update your local Git repo</h1>
<p>Here we want to practise how to update the local Git repo, keeping
track of the changes with Git. First, create a file called
<code>mostres_analitzades_bcn.csv</code> with the subset of the data in
<code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> corresponding to the rows derived
from the area of Barcelona (see <a href="/practical2/">practical 2</a>).
Once you have generated that file, check out the status of the repo. You
should notice that Git has detected a new file that is untracked. Stage
this untracked file and commit the change to the repo.</p>
<h1 id="upload-your-local-git-repo-to-github">Upload your local Git repo
to GitHub</h1>
<p>Here we want to create in GitHub a remote Git repo connected to our
local one. We illustrate such process using the previous local Git
repo.</p>
<p>To get started, log into your GitHub account, click on the plus sign
on the top-right and select “New repository” from the pull-down
menu.</p>
<p><img src="./GHnewrepo1.png" /></p>
<p>In the next page, type <code>practical3</code> in the textbox under
<code>Repository name</code>, select <code>Private</code> for the type
of repository and press the button <code>Create repository</code>.</p>
<p><img src="./GHnewrepo2.png" /></p>
<p>At this point you have created in your GitHub account an empty Git
repo called <code>practical3</code>. We are going to connect it now with
our local Git repo of <code>practical3</code>. Make sure your CWD is the
Git repo <code>practical3</code> in your local disk and follow the
instructions in the GitHub page under the title <strong>“… or push an
existing repository from the command line”</strong>. They consist of the
following three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a new connection to your remote GitHub repo with
<code>git remote add</code>, <strong>REPLACING</strong> the
<code>fcbstudent</code> word below <strong>BY YOUR OWN
USERNAME</strong>):</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/fcbstudent/practical3.git</code></pre>
<p>You can check whether this connection has been successfully
established by using the <code>-v</code> option with the
<code>remote</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/fcbstudent/practical3.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/fcbstudent/practical3.git (push)</code></pre>
<p>If you see <strong>no</strong> URL connection specified to the right
of the word <code>origin</code> or if the connection you see is to the
<code>fcbstudent</code> user instead of your own, then you have
misspecified the repo URL. Before you try again to add the correct
remote connection, you should remove this <em>bogus</em> one by
typing:</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote remove origin</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create the default branch under the name <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -M main</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Push the contents of the current branch in the local Git repo to
the upstream main branch in the GitHub repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push -u origin main

 * [new branch]      main -&gt; main
branch &#39;main&#39; set up to track &#39;origin/main&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>In this step you may be asked for your GitHub username and a
password. <strong>Warning</strong>: the password that you enter here to
perform this Git operation on a remote repository <strong>is
not</strong> the one you use to enter into your GitHub profile, but it
should be a <em>personal access token</em> that you have previously
generated (see the previous instructions on section <a
href="#setting-up-a-personal-access-token-in-github">Setting up a
personal access token in GitHub</a>). If you enter the wrong password
then, instead of the previous output, you will get the following
error:</p>
<pre><code>remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
Please use a personal access token instead.
remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information
fatal: Authentication failed for &#39;https://github.com/fcbstudent/practical3.git/&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In such a case, you should either try again with your <em>personal
access token</em> or, if you have not generate it yet, then go to the
previous instructions on <a
href="#setting-up-a-personal-access-token-in-github">Setting up a
personal access token in GitHub</a>). and follow the steps to generate a
<em>personal access token</em> for GitHub. If you think you are using
the correct <em>personal access token</em>, but you still get an error,
then probably the connection to the remote GitHub repo has not been
correctly established. In such a case, go back to step 1, use the given
command to remove this current connection and try to add it again,
making sure that the GitHub URL is correct.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Click now on the link to the private repo on the top-left of your
GitHub account (<code>yourgithubusername/practical3</code>) to go to the
page of the repo and check that the files have been successfully
uploaded to GitHub.</p>
<p><img src="./GHnewrepo3.png" /></p>
<p>Check out also that the status of your local repo tells that it is up
to date with the new remote connection.</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;.

nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>
<p>The GitHub page for the repo has several tabs, where the one called
“Settings” can be used to configure some of the other tabs and perform
actions such as switching the visibility from private to public or
delete entirely this Git repo from GitHub.</p>
<h1 id="cloning-a-github-repo-into-a-local-git-repo">Cloning a GitHub
repo into a local Git repo</h1>
<p>The reverse operation of uploading a local repo to a GitHub is
<strong>cloning</strong> a GitHub repo into a local repo. When you
<em>clone</em> a GitHub repo, you are copying into your local filesystem
all the files, version history and branches from the GitHub repo.</p>
<p>To <em>clone</em> a GitHub repo into your local filesystem you use
the Git command <code>clone</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME [DIRECTORY]</code></pre>
<p>where <code>USERNAME</code> is the username owner of the repo you
want to <em>clone</em>, while <code>REPONAME</code> is the name of the
Git repo you want to clone. <strong>Optionally</strong>, you can give a
directory name in <code>DIRECTORY</code> to clone the repo under a
directory called differently to the <code>REPONAME</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, go to your home directory and clone your recently
created GitHub repo <code>practical3</code> into a different name such
as <code>practical3copy</code> by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/practical3 practical3copy</code></pre>
<p>where you should replace <code>USERNAME</code> by your username. The
system will ask you for your usename and password, where you should copy
and paste your GitHub access token as a password.</p>
<h1 id="push-changes-to-github">Push changes to GitHub</h1>
<p>Here, we are going to see how update the new local copy of our remote
GitHub repo and send (<em>push</em> in Git terminology) those changes to
the remote GitHub repo. Enter in the directory of this new local copy of
the GitHub repo and introduce a change by creating a
<code>README.md</code> file using a Unix shell terminal output
redirection as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd practical3copy
$ cat &gt; README.md
This is Practical 3!</code></pre>
<p>Remember to press the keys <code>Ctrl+d</code> once you’ve typed the
text. Now list the files, verify that a new file called
<code>README.md</code> is there, that it has the contents you’ve typed
and check the status of the repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls
README.md                   mostres_analitzades_bcn.csv
mostres_analitzades.csv     virus_detectats.csv
$ cat README.md 
This is Practical 3!

<p>If this last step has been successful, you should be able to see the
new file after reloading the webpage of GitHub, and actually its
contents as shown here below (a <code>README.md</code> file at the root
of a GitHub repo has a special <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes">treatment</a>
in the GitHub page of the repo).</p>
<p><img src="./GHnewrepo4.png" /></p>
<h1 id="pull-changes-from-github">Pull changes from GitHub</h1>
<p>You have your initial copy of the GitHub repo at
<code>~/practical3</code> and a modified copy at
<code>~/practical3copy</code>, where the latter has been synchronized
with the remote GitHub repo. Now, let’s see how could we update
(<em>pull</em> in Git terminology) our initial copy with the latest
changes made in the second copy of our repo. First enter the directory
of the initial copy of the GitHub repo (here we assume it was created at
the <em>home</em> directory) and verify it lacks the last file
<code>README.md</code> we have added to the GitHub repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd
$ cd practical3
$ ls
mostres_analitzades.csv     virus_detectats.csv
mostres_analitzades_bcn.csv</code></pre>
<p>Second, <em>pull</em> the changes from GitHub and verify the new file
<code>README.md</code> has been added to this copy of the GitHub
repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ git pull

<p>In general, you will not work with two local copies of the same
GitHub repo in the same computer. <strong>We have used these two copies
here only to illustrate</strong> how to <em>clone</em> a remote repo,
and <em>push</em> and <em>pull</em> changes from that repo. The main
utility of these actions is when either you work in two or more
computers and need to synchronize your local copies of the GitHub repo,
or you are working with collaborators that all update the same GitHub
repo.</p>
<h1 id="undo-changes-in-your-local-git-repo">Undo changes in your local
Git repo</h1>
<p>One of the great things about working with a version-control system
is the ability to undo changes, reverting to some previous state of your
files. This functionality, however, only applies to changes that have
been staged and committed to the Git database. For this reason, it is
important and useful to commit your changes often. Depending on the kind
change you want to undo, the command to undo that change will be
different. Here we cover a few cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restore a deleted file.</strong> There are several
options depending on the moment in which you deleted the file:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The file was deleted before or after the deletion was staged, but
the deletion was not commited to the Git database. We illustrate here
this case by removing the file <code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code> and
immediately restoring it again:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm mostres_analitzades.csv
$ ls
README.md                   virus_detectats.csv
mostres_analitzades_bcn.csv
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
  deleted:    mostres_analitzades.csv

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)

$ git checkout HEAD mostres_analitzades.csv ## &lt;-- RESTORING GIT COMMAND
Updated 1 path from 7b1b617
$ ls
README.md                   mostres_analitzades_bcn.csv
mostres_analitzades.csv     virus_detectats.csv</code></pre></li>
<li><p>After the file was deleted, that deletion was staged and commited
to the Git database and no other commits were introduced. Let’s
illustrate it again removing the file
<code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code>, but this time staging and
commiting that change:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm mostres_analitzades.csv
$ git add .
$ git commit -m &#39;Removed mostres_analitzades.csv&#39;
[main 7946ebf] Removed mostres_analitzades.csv

$ git status

Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/main&#39; by 1 commit.
  (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)

$ git reset HEAD~1                         ## &lt;-- RESTORING GIT COMMAND

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The Git command <code>git reset HEAD~1</code> reverts the deletion
commit leaving it as an unstaged change and therefore, you should still
apply the previous option 1 above to recover the file:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout HEAD mostres_analitzades.csv ## &lt;-- RESTORING GIT COMMAND
Updated 1 path from 7b1b617
$ ls
README.md                   mostres_analitzades_bcn.csv
mostres_analitzades.csv     virus_detectats.csv</code></pre></li>
<li><p>After the file was deleted, that deletion was staged and commited
to the Git database and afterwards other commits were also introduced.
Let’s illustrate it again removing the file
<code>mostres_analitzades.csv</code>, but this time staging and
commiting that change and staging and commiting one further change:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm mostres_analitzades.csv
$ git add .
$ git commit -m &#39;Removed mostres_analitzades.csv&#39;

<p>At this point we should look up the <a

<code>git log -- removedfilename</code>:</p>

<p>Then, check out the file from the commit before the one that deleted
it using the command
<code>git checkout commithash~1 -- removedfilename</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout 588acf0ecace42d0b53cb00b71bcc500f3fd4aba~1 -- mostres_analitzades.csv

<p>Here the characters <code>~1</code> at the end of the commit hash
indicate Git to go exactly one commit before the given commit hash.
Finally, you should stage and commit the recovered file since it will
appear to Git as a new file:</p>

<p>In this example we have a copy of our repo in GitHub, and for that
reason the status command keeps tellings us that our local copy has 3
commits that are not yet synchronized with the remote repo (<em>Your
branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 3 commits</em>). We can synchronize
these 3 commits with the remote repo by doing <em>git push</em>:</p>
